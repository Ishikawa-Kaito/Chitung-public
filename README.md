Public version of Chitung the Mirai-based Tencent QQ bot.

This project aims to provide users with a "Lite" and open version of Chitung. Although Chitung itself is
already open sourced, it contains numerous highly customized and personalized functions, which makes
it almost impossible to be implanted.

Public Chitung allows user to run, customize and manage their own Chitung.
