## Public Version of Chitung 
### - the Mirai-based Tencent QQ bot.

This project aims to provide users with a lite and open version of Chitung. Although Chitung itself has
already been open sourced, it contains numerous highly customized and personalized functions, which makes
it almost impossible to be used by others than the original developers.

Public Chitung allows users to run, customize and manage their own Chitung.
